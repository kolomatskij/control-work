# Project for OOP course at university

##About



This is File_Storage project in OOP style.
 
I made it with C# language.



Here we have two types of users:



1. Admin

2. User



And they have different permissions.

Registration form is absent.



Also we can do actions with files:



1. Create new file

2. Open and read file

3. Open and change file

4. Delete file



All files are saved in .txt format.



To use this program you need to use that:



1. Logins "admin" or "user"

2. Password for admin "1234"




##Control Questions


####1. Which principles of SOLID was used in this project?



Single responsibility principle - was fully used.

 

Open/closed principle - partially, because I had not enough time to make it better.
  


####2.Which design patterns were used in the project?



Object Oriented: Singleton.



####3.Which patterns would be used if another programming language would be used?

I think that if we would used programming languages such as Java or C#, we would used Strategy pattern with them and maby Builder pattern.
